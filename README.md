# Fruit Ninja Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular Fruit Ninja game using JavaFX. The game involves slicing various fruits as they are thrown up into the air, while avoiding bombs that are also thrown up. The game provides a fun and engaging way to improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and concentration.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, you will need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website, while JavaFX can be downloaded as a standalone library or as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Once you have Java and JavaFX installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine and import the project into your preferred Java IDE. 

## Usage

To run the game, simply run the `Main` class in your IDE. This will launch the game window, which displays the main menu screen. From here, you can start a new game, or exit the game.

When you start a new game, the game window will display a game screen, where fruits and bombs are thrown up into the air. To slice a fruit, you need to click and drag the mouse over the fruit. If you slice a fruit, you will earn points, and if you slice a bomb, you will lose a life. The game ends when you have no lives left.
